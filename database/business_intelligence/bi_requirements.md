Project: Early Spoilage Detection System

1. Strategic Objectives

The primary goal of the BI implementation is to transition warehouse operations from reactive waste management to predictive spoilage prevention.

Reduce Waste: Identify at-risk batches before they spoil.

Optimize Labor: Direct staff only to areas requiring intervention (Management by Exception).

Ensure Compliance: Maintain digital proof of proper storage conditions for food safety regulations.

2. Decision Support Needs

The system must support the following critical decisions:

Immediate Operational Decisions: * Which crop batch requires cooling immediately?

Is a specific sensor malfunctioning?

Tactical Staffing Decisions:

Do we have enough staff covering the night shift to handle alerts?

Which employees respond fastest to critical warnings?

Strategic Planning Decisions:

Which crop types have the highest spoilage rate historically?

Are specific aisles in the warehouse prone to "hot spots"?
